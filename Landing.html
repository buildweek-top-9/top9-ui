        <h1>MY TOP 9</h1>
        <p>Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as Iâ€™ve always known him, Jeff. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! Come along, Pond! No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name.<p>

            <p>I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Come along, Pond! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Bow ties are cool. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name.</p>

            <p>Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Goodbye, Clara. Come along, Pond! Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.</p>

            <p>I never know why. I only know who. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Brave heart, Clara. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know.</p>
